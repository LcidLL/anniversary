            <h2>A Letter to the Love of My Life</h2>
            <p>Dear Kiara,</p>
            <p>Happy Anniversary, baby kow!!!! Finally, kaya na kita gawaan ng webpage. These past 2 years we've been together, it feels like I've been with you for half of my life already - sobrang dami na natin nagawa, I legit think these have been the most eventful 2 years of my life so far, and I have you to thank for it. Thank you so much for always bringing me along in doing the things you enjoy, bringing me to meet every single one of your friends, and bringing me to places that are important to you. I want to continue joining you in doing all the things you love. Alam ko mabilis ako mapagod, but that doesn't mean na I don't cherish every moment I spend with you. Pero, kahit anong gawin natin, kahit saan, basta kasama ka, it will be a core memory. (i-nonote ko rin sa phone ko because I am forgetful haha) </p>
            <p>Mahal na mahal kita. Know that in everything I do, lagi ka included sa mga naiisip ko na gusto mangyari. I'm not perfect, I know, but I you can rest assured that I see you in all of my possible futures.</p>
            <p>THAT SAID, I HOPE YOU ALSO ENJOYED THIS PAST YEAR TOGETHER. Alam ko marami pa ako utang sayo na kanta, so here's my other surprise...</p>
            <p>With all my love,<p>
            <p>Lcid</p>
